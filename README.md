# make_pulse_with_nucleoF334R8
This project has the porpuse of making pulses with the function PWM of a timer, in this case TIM1 of the STM32 nucleoboard

The goal is of a major porpuse, which is making a full detector of the radiation absorbe by objects. Rigth now, this makes only the generation of the pulse, and later we will need to see if it is abosrobe or not.
